# Assistant Extensions page reference

Use the **Assistant Extensions** page to enable the Model Context Protocol (MCP) client, open and edit the configuration file, refresh the settings, and review server status.

For setup, refer to [Configure and use MCP servers](xref:mcp-configure).

The **Assistant Extensions** page contains the following tools:

**General Settings**

This section contains the following setting:

| Setting	| Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Enable MCP Tools** | Toggle to enable or disable the MCP client for the current project. |
| **Tool Call Timeout (seconds)** | Specifies how long Assistant waits for an MCP tool call to complete before timing out. Increase this value if your MCP tools run long operations or invoke external programs that take longer to respond. |

**Server Configuration**

This section contains the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Open Config	File** | Opens the MCP configuration file for editing. |
| **Refresh Config File and Reload Servers** | Reloads the configuration and restarts servers. Use this after you make any edits. |

**Path Configuration**

This section contains the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Path Accessible by Unity** | Displays the PATH environment variable as seen by the Unity Editor process. This is often different from your shell PATH. |
| **User Path** | Provide the PATH that MCP servers use when launched from Unity. Paste the full PATH from your terminal or add specific directories (for example, C:\Program Files\Git\bin (macOS: `/opt/homebrew/bin`)) so Unity can resolve the required executables. When you change this field, select **Refresh Config File and Reload Servers** to apply it. |

**Servers**

This section contains the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Server Inspector** | Shows server status, messages, tool manifest, and connection details. If the server fails to start or connect, the inspector includes error details and a link to troubleshooting guidance. |
| **Server Name** |	The display name of the server from your configuration. If the name starts with a tilde (`~`), the server is hidden and won’t start. |
| **Server Status** | The current state of the server. For example, `FailedToStart` or `StartedSuccessfully`. |
| **Status Message** | Displays results with error text from the server. For example, `Failed to connect to server`. |
| **Tools** | Shows the number of tools discovered from the server’s manifest. It also lists the available tool names, descriptions, and parameters required by the server.|
