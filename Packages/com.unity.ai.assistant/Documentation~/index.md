# Unity AI Assistant

Unity AI Assistant (Assistant) is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool integrated into the Unity Editor. Use it to create assets, automate workflows, analyze performance, and perform project actions using natural-language prompts.

Assistant works in a conversation-based interface and operates in three modes depending on what you want to accomplish:

- [**Ask**](xref:assistant-modes#ask-mode) mode provides explanations, guidance, and project insights using read-only tools. It doesn't modify your scene or assets.
- [**Agent**](xref:assistant-modes#agent-mode) mode performs actions in your project, such as create assets, modify GameObjects, or update settings. All modifying actions require your approval and respect your permission settings.
- [**Plan**](xref:assistant-modes#plan-mode) mode generates a step-by-step plan for a complex task. You can review the plan and approve it before its implementation in the Agent mode.

Use **Ask** mode when you need information or suggestions. Use **Agent** mode when you want Assistant to perform changes in the Unity Editor. Use the **Plan** mode for complex tasks that require multiple steps or when you want to review the proposed approach before implementation.

## Create assets with Generators and Assistant

Assistant integrates with Unity [Generators](xref:overview) to create and refine visual, audio, and animation assets directly in your project.

With Generators and Assistant, you can:

- Create assets, such as sprites, textures, materials, and cubemaps.
- Generate 3D objects and terrain layers.
- Create and edit sound clips.
- Generate and refine animation clips.
- Edit audio clips using natural-language instructions.

You can use Generators directly for fine-grained control or use Assistant to guide the workflow using prompts and project context.

## Use skills to extend capabilities

Assistant includes skills, which are specialized modules that provide expert guidance and specific tools for a particular area of Unity development. In **Ask** mode, skills provide focused guidance. In **Agent** mode, skills can perform tool-enabled actions in the Unity Editor.

For example, a Cinemachine skill can assist with setting up virtual cameras, dolly tracks, and cinematic shots.

You can discover and invoke skills using natural-language prompts, such as:

- `What specialized skills do you have?`
- `List the specialized skills available in this project and what each can do.`
- `Use the Cinemachine skill to set up a dolly camera shot.`

## Monitor usage and manage access

Use the Unity Dashboard to [monitor your AI usage](https://cloud.unity.com/home/ai/usage), [manage your point balance](https://cloud.unity.com/home/ai/points), and [configure settings](https://cloud.unity.com/home/ai/settings) across your organization. This helps you understand how often Unity AI is used, control costs, and ensure the right team members have access to the appropriate tools.

For more information, refer to the [Unity Dashboard AI settings](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/ai) documentation.

## Install and open Assistant

To install and launch Assistant in the Unity Editor, refer to [Install Assistant](xref:install-assistant).
